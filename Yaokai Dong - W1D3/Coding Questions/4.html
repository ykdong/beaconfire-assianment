        <h3>The Raven</h3>
        <pre>
          Deep into that darkness peering,

          Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,

          Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

          Ever dared to dream before;

          But the silence was unbroken,

          And the stillness gave no token,

          And the only word there spoken

          Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"

          This I whispered, and an echo

          Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"

          Merely this, and nothing more.

        <h3>The New Colossus</h3>
        <pre>
          Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

          With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

          Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

          A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

          Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

          Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

          Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

          The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

          “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

          With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

          Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

          The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

          Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

          I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

        <h3>Because I could not stop for Death</h3>
        <pre>
          Because I could not stop for Death,

          He kindly stopped for me;

          The carriage held but just ourselves

          And Immortality.

        <h3>Sonnet 18</h3>
        <pre>
          Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

          Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

          Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

          And summer's lease hath all too short a date;

          Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

          And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

          And every fair from fair sometime declines,

          By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;

          But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

          Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;

          Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,

          When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:

          So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

          So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

        <h3>Kubla Khan</h3>
        <pre>
          And all should cry, Beware! Beware!

          His flashing eyes, his floating hair!

          Weave a circle round him thrice,

          And close your eyes with holy dread

          For he on honey-dew hath fed,

          And drunk the milk of Paradise.

        <h3>The Second Coming</h3>
        <pre>
          Turning and turning in the widening gyre   

          The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

          Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

          Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

          The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   

          The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

          The best lack all conviction, while the worst   

          Are full of passionate intensity.

        <h3>The Lady of Shalott</h3>
        <pre>
          Willows whiten, aspens shiver.

          The sunbeam showers break and quiver

          In the stream that runneth ever

          By the island in the river

          Flowing down to Camelot.

          Four gray walls, and four gray towers

          Overlook a space of flowers,

          And the silent isle imbowers

          The Lady of Shalott.

        <h3>She Walks in Beauty</h3>
        <pre>
          She walks in beauty, like the night

          Of cloudless climes and starry skies;

          And all that's best of dark and bright

          Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

          Thus mellowed to that tender light

          Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

        <h3>O Captain! My Capain!</h3>
        <pre>
          But O heart! heart! heart!

          O the bleeding drops of red,

          Where on the deck my Captain lies,

          Fallen cold and dead.

          O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;

          Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;

          For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;

          For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning

        <h3>I Have a Rendezvous With Death</h3>
        <pre>
          I have a rendezvous with Death

          At some disputed barricade

          When Spring comes back with rustling shade

          And apple blossoms fill the air.

          I have a rendezvous with Death

          When Spring brings back blue days and fair

        <h3>I'm nobody! Who are you?</h3>
        <pre>
          I'm nobody! Who are you?

          Are you nobody, too?

          Then there's a pair of us — don't tell!

          They'd banish us, you know.

          How dreary to be somebody!

          How public, like a frog

          To tell your name the livelong day

          To an admiring bog!

        <h3>Ode to a Nightingale</h3>
        <pre>
          Away! away! for I will fly to thee,

          Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,

          But on the viewless wings of Poesy,

          Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:

          Already with thee! tender is the night,

          And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,

          Clustered around by all her starry Fays;

          But here there is no light,

          Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown

          Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways
